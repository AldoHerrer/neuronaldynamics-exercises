# Neuronal Dynamics: Python Exercises

This repository contains python exercises accompanying the book **[Neuronal Dynamics](http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/) by Wulfram Gerstner, Werner M. Kistler, Richard Naud and Liam Paninski**. References to relevant chapters will be added in the [Teaching Materials](http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/lectures.html) section of the book homepage.

## Documentation

Our [documentation is over at readthedocs](http://neuronaldynamics-exercises.readthedocs.org/).

## Brian1

We are currently rewriting the python exercises to use the more recent [Brian2 Simulator](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2). The old brian1 exercises are available on the [brian1 branch](https://github.com/EPFL-LCN/neuronaldynamics-exercises/tree/brian1).
