# Neuronal Dynamics: Python Exercises

This repository contains python exercises accompanying the book **[Neuronal Dynamics](http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/) by Wulfram Gerstner, Werner M. Kistler, Richard Naud and Liam Paninski**. References to relevant chapters will be added in the [Teaching Materials](http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/lectures.html) section of the book homepage.

Most exercises rely on the python based [Brian neural network simulator ](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2).

## Installation

Each exercise is described in its own folder by a PDF file. The exercises are intended to be solved using the provided python classes. To run the code contained in each folder, the following requirements should be met:

* Python>=2.7
* [Brian Simulator](https://github.com/brian-team/brian)
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Scipy [only required in some exercises]

You can also install all requirements by running ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` from the main directory of this repository, in a console.

## Brian2

We are currently rewriting the examples to use the more recent [Brian2 Simulator](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2). These are available on the [master branch](https://github.com/EPFL-LCN/neuronaldynamics-exercises/tree/master).
